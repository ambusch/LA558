<h1>D3 Visuals</h1>
<h3>Counties Blue and Red, Moving Right and Left</h3><div>
<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/11/sunday-review/counties-moving.html">Link</a><div>
In this visual, I like that the map shows change through movement at different speeds and lengths. This map feels active, which can be useful for maps dealing with people and opinions. I like that the shift in vote margin is also demonstrated by isolated states and areas, where the other states are still visible but the vote margin shift is a different color so the isolated state stands out more. <div>
The main components that would need to be coded are the distances, size, scale, and colors, as well as the array of data. <div><div>
<h3>Hexbin Map</h3><div>
<a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/hexbin-map">Link</a><div>
I like that the visual shows two variables, in this case, quantity and age, in a visual manner without relying on a popup. This type of visual is more clear than a map where the user has to interact to find quantity or sum, and allows multiple qualities of a dataset to be shown at once. This visual would be especially useful for any type of map showing quantities. <div>
In this example, the elements that would need to be coded are the size and color of the hexagons, and the array of locations. The scale of both the colors and the size of the object would need to be coded as well. <div><div>
<h3>Over the Decades, How States Have Shifted</h3><div>
<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/15/us/politics/swing-history.html">Link</a><div>
I like this visual because it shows change over time as well as size. The popups are useful and highlight specific data paths well. This map also has the ability to show two sides of an axis, which presents data in a different manner. It reflects specific change rather than change through a percentage of the total population. Multiple variables can be shown on this visual. <div>
In this example, the elements that would need to be coded are the scale bars, box size, and curve size. <div><div>
