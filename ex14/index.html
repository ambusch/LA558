<h1>R and Shiny</h1>
<div>

I have used R a bit in the past to sift through data, and I believe it is far more thorough (albeit less user-friendly) than the Stata software the CRP department at Iowa State teaches in the 301 course. Shiny seems to be a tool that could be immensely helpful in planning projects, from providing a way for data to be easily interpreted from R or creating an interface for engagement with the public. Professionally, I will be attending law school next year and plan on pursuing public interest law for a career. As a future lawyer, I may not be completing statistical analysis on a daily basis, but that does not preclude me from a need for data interpretation. Data is pervasive in every part of our lives, and can assist in understanding human behavior and patterns.

As I know R to be a software requiring quite a bit of training, I would need to work through exercises either online or in a book. If I were to teach myself R and Shiny, I would start by going through online training exercises. I find it easier to learn by trial and error. The Ahiny website seems to have a through tutorial list, which would be useful in experimenting with the software.
