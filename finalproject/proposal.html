Elected Official Demographics

<div>
This project will focus on demographics of elected officials and how these demographics compare to their constituencies.
<div>
Diversity has not been historically represented in the elected officials of the United States. While the current Congress is currently the most diverse congressional body yet, this representative body still does not mirror the composition of the country. This project will primarily focus on Congressional representation, exploring demographics of each congressional district and examining the demographics of their elected officials. Part two of the project will look toward Iowa as a case study to break down representation at different levels of government (i.e., state and local elected officials). 
<div>
I will use Leaflet and geoJSON to create layers and layer controls in my maps. If I choose to host the data externally, I may use jQuery as well. I also plan on using either highcharts, highmaps or Tableau to supplement the maps with other forms of data visualization. 
<div>
I have already collected data from the U.S. Congress website as well as data.gov. I have a list of current Congressional members and their districts as well as demographics at each congressional district. 
<div>
The biggest problem I imagine will be parsing the data. I will inevitably be dealing with a large dataset and hope to troubleshoot errors early in the project.
